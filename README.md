# personalProjects
This repo contains some of my little personal projects

# Weather App
- a simple weather app where I've implemented the OpenWeatherMap API
- ToDo: change the background to a dark one when it's evening/night + different images (moon, stars etc)

# FrontEnd Mini Projects
- a bunch of "entry level" projects using HTML/CSS/Vanilla JS
